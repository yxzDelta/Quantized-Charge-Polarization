# Quantized-Charge-Polarization
Codes for arXiv:2211.09127

All calculations are in square lattices, generalization to other lattices (eg. honeycomb) is straightforward

Include 3 notebooks, calculate dislocation charge, linear momentum, and 1-d polarization(Resta's formula) respectively

Each note is separated into the Hamiltonian diagonalization section and the data plotting section. If any of the code doesn't work, try restarting Mathematica or change "ParallelTable" to "Table".
