"Quantized charge polarization as a many-body invariant in (2+1)D crystalline topological states and Hofstadter butterflies"

All calculations are done in square lattices Hofstadter model, generalization to other lattices (eg. honeycomb) is straightforward

Include 3 notebooks, calculate dislocation charge, linear momentum, and 1-d polarization(Resta's formula) respectively

Each note is separated into the Hamiltonian diagonalization section and the data plotting section. If any of the code doesn't work, try restarting Mathematica or change "ParallelTable" to "Table".
